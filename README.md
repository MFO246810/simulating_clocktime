## Project Overview

This project simulates the execution of processes and events within a time-shared system. The simulation clock manages multiple processes with various priorities, handling CPU and user interactions efficiently. The simulation is designed to emulate real-world clock functionality, providing a controlled environment to test and visualize scheduling algorithms.

## Features

- **Clock Simulation**: Accurately simulates clock ticks and time passage.
- **Priority Queues**: Manages high-priority (CPU and user processes) and low-priority events.
- **Event Handling**: Simulates user interactions and process scheduling.
- **Multi-core Processor Support**: Simulates processes on multi-core systems for realistic performance testing.
- **Detailed Logging**: Tracks and logs event execution for analysis.
