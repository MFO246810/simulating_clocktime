# Simulation Clock Time

A C++ project that simulates a clock to manage events and processes in a time-shared system. The program schedules and tracks events, simulating clock time and the execution of processes with priority-based handling.

## Project Overview

This project simulates the execution of processes and events within a time-shared system. The simulation clock manages multiple processes with various priorities, handling CPU and user interactions efficiently. The simulation is designed to emulate real-world clock functionality, providing a controlled environment to test and visualize scheduling algorithms.

## Features

- **Clock Simulation**: Accurately simulates clock ticks and time passage.
- **Priority Queues**: Manages high-priority (CPU and user processes) and low-priority events.
- **Event Handling**: Simulates user interactions and process scheduling.
- **Multi-core Processor Support**: Simulates processes on multi-core systems for realistic performance testing.
- **Detailed Logging**: Tracks and logs event execution for analysis.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simulation-clocktime.git
